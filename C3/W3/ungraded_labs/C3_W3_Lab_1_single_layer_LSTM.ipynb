    "# Ungraded Lab: Single Layer LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this course, you've been using mostly basic dense layers and embeddings to build your models. It detects how the combination of words (or subwords) in the input text determines the output class. In the labs this week, you will look at other layers you can use to build your models. Most of these will deal with *Recurrent Neural Networks*, a kind of model that takes the ordering of inputs into account. This makes it suitable for different applications such as parts-of-speech tagging, music composition, language translation, and the like. For example, you may want your model to differentiate sentiments even if the words used in two sentences are the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1: My friends do like the movie but I don't. --> negative review\n",
    "2: My friends don't like the movie but I do. --> positive review\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first layer you will be looking at is the [*LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)*](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM). In a nutshell, it computes the state of a current timestep and passes it on to the next timesteps where this state is also updated. The process repeats until the final timestep where the output computation is affected by all previous states. Not only that, it can be configured to be bidirectional so you can get the relationship of later words to earlier ones. If you want to go in-depth of how these processes work, you can look at the [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models) course of the Deep Learning Specialization. For this lab, you can take advantage of Tensorflow's APIs that implements the complexities of these layers for you. This makes it easy to just plug it in to your model. Let's see how to do that in the next sections below. "
